# User Created Events Endpoint Fix

## Summary
Fixed the endpoints for getting user-created events by adding the requested `event/user/self` endpoint to the list of possible endpoints tried by the `fetchUserCreatedEvents` function.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Function (`api/event.ts`)
- **File**: `api/event.ts`
- **Function**: `fetchUserCreatedEvents`
- **Change**: Added `event/user/self` as the first endpoint to try
- **Before**: Only tried 4 endpoints starting with `/user/created-events`
- **After**: Now tries 5 endpoints starting with `/event/user/self`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
- Added detailed console logging with `[fetchUserCreatedEvents]` prefix
- Improved error messages to show which endpoint failed and why
- Added response data type validation logging
- Better distinction between 404 (not found) and other errors

### 3. Endpoint Priority Order
The function now tries endpoints in this order:
1. **`/event/user/self`** ‚Üê **NEW** (your requested endpoint)
2. `/user/created-events`
3. `/event/user/created`
4. `/events/user/created`
5. `/event/created-by-user`

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test-user-events-endpoint.js` for manual testing
- Includes instructions for testing with real authentication tokens
- Tests all endpoints and shows which one succeeds

## How It Works

1. The app tries the `event/user/self` endpoint first
2. If successful and returns an array, it uses that data
3. If not successful, it falls back to the next endpoint
4. If all endpoints fail, it uses client-side filtering of all events
5. Detailed logging shows exactly what's happening

## Testing

To test the new endpoint:
1. Get a valid authentication token from your app
2. Set environment variable: `set TEST_TOKEN=your_actual_token`
3. Run: `node test-user-events-endpoint.js`

## Usage in App

The changes are automatically used by:
- `useUserCreatedEvents()` hook in `hooks/useApiQueries.ts`
- Events tab "My Events" section in `app/(tabs)/events.tsx`
- Any component that displays user-created events

## Fallback Behavior

If the `event/user/self` endpoint doesn't exist or fails:
- The app will automatically try other endpoint patterns
- If all API endpoints fail, it falls back to client-side filtering
- Users will still see their created events (if any exist in the system)

## Logging

When debugging, look for console messages with `[fetchUserCreatedEvents]` prefix to see:
- Which endpoints are being tried
- Response status codes
- Whether responses contain valid data
- Which endpoint ultimately succeeds
