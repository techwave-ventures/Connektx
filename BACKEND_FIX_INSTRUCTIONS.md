# Backend Fix: Change authorId to UserId in Populate Paths

## Problem
The backend API is trying to populate `comments.authorId` but the schema uses `comments.UserId` instead.

Error: `"Cannot populate path \`comments.authorId\` because it is not in your schema. Set the \`strictPopulate\` option to false to override."`

## Solution

### 1. Find the Community Posts Endpoint
Look for the endpoint that handles `GET /community/:id/posts` in your backend code.

### 2. Update the Populate Path
Change all instances of `comments.authorId` to `comments.UserId` in the populate calls.

**BEFORE (causing errors):**
```javascript
// In your community posts controller
.populate('comments.authorId')  // ❌ This is wrong
.populate({
  path: 'comments.authorId',    // ❌ This is wrong
  select: 'name profileImage'
})
```

**AFTER (correct):**
```javascript
// In your community posts controller
.populate('comments.UserId')   // ✅ This is correct
.populate({
  path: 'comments.UserId',     // ✅ This is correct
  select: 'name profileImage'
})
```

### 3. Check All Related Endpoints
Also check and update these endpoints if they have similar issues:
- `GET /post/feed/home` (home feed)
- Any other endpoints that populate comments

### 4. Alternative Quick Fix (if schema can't be changed)
If you can't modify the populate paths immediately, you can add `strictPopulate: false` to your schema:

```javascript
// In your Comment schema definition
const CommentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // ... your existing fields
}, {
  strictPopulate: false  // This allows flexible populate paths
});
```

## Affected Communities
These communities are currently failing due to this issue:
- `68c6863538727831fb9f2fbf` (abxc)
- `68c45a81cdf3c826b1049449` (Sjsjs)

These communities work fine:
- `68c45d22cdf3c826b1049868` (Mazi community ahe)
- `68c457ddcdf3c826b10491e7` (New community)

## Testing After Fix
After implementing the fix:
1. Test the failing community IDs: `68c6863538727831fb9f2fbf` and `68c45a81cdf3c826b1049449`
2. Verify they return posts instead of errors
3. Ensure the working communities still function correctly

## Frontend Workaround (Already Implemented)
The frontend already has graceful error handling for this issue, so users won't see crashes. However, the proper backend fix is still needed for full functionality.
